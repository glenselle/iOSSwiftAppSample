# iOSSwiftAppSample

**Note: The code in this repo will not compile because it was obfuscated to protect the identity of the client. Language stats are also skewed by the Objective-C libraries used within custom Swift code (by using a bridging header).**

This repo is the source code of an iOS application I was responsible for converting from Objective-C to Swift. The app  was pushed to the app store for a year before it was removed after a business model pivot caused development to shift to a new codebase so as to retain the original app in its original codebase.
